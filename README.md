# Mywebsite
I'm trying to make my own website by coding HTML and JavaScript in Atom. 

I wrote a few lines of code to determine my web style in css file. 
  
  ```	
   color:darkred;
   line-height: 1.5em;
   letter-spacing: 0.02em;
   font-family:'Domine', serif;
   margin-top: 1.25em;
   margin-bottom: 0.8em;
   ```
